Huffman Coding: 
This C project implements Huffman coding, an efficient algorithm for data compression. 
It constructs a Huffman tree, with multi-layered nodes based on character frequencies and generates 
variable-length codes. 
The project compresses a text file by replacing characters with their corresponding codes, achieving a compact 
representation. 
It also includes functionality for decompressing the compressed data back to its original form. 
The project evaluates the compression ratio and measures the time taken for compression and decompression. 
By exploring Huffman coding, we have understand its effectiveness in reducing file sizes and its significance 
in data compression applications.
